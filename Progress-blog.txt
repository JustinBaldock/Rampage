First tried to use C64 PRG Studio to create a modern version. I had some problems with functions and struggled for a while.
Then I tried C64 Studio and felt like I was having more success.
I had to find PDS documentation so I could work out what some of the pseudo code commands were doing.
After several days I got it to a point were it compiled. But it doesn't run. I tried to do some debugging without luck.
I figured I should compare it to the original release and see where the code was placed.
I loaded up the game in Vice and took a snapshot. I then carved out the $FFFF bytes and saved as a hex file. I then searched for machine code.

RAMP.asm starts with 
SEI
LDX #255
machine code = 78 A2 FF
I could only find that code in one place, $8311

COPY.asm starts with
some code, there are 3 x INX, machine code = E8 E8 E8
Only find code in one place, $B3F3

DEBUG.asm starts with
CLC ADC $f4 = 18 69 f4
Only find code in one place, $9DDF

DIS.asm starts with
LDA #1 JSR = a9 01 20
Found two places, 

IRQ.asm has code 
AND #1 beq = 29 01 f0
Found 3 places, 
LDA CIA2+13 = ad/a5 dd 0d 85/8d xx xx 29 02
I think this starts at $77FD

DJCODE.asm
Has some code close to start with LSR LSR LSR SEC SBC = 4A 4A 4A 38 f9
Found 3 places! Last place.$A5C5, back tracing a bit, 
I think this part starts at $A592

MOVE.asm
10 xx 60 BD, with bunch of tracing
This part starts at $B27E

BUILD.asm
Starts with A9 00 8D xx xx AC xx xx
