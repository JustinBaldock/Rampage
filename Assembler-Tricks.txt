"Relative jump too far" in assembly, and code structure

It is a common problem, and it has a common solution. instead of
CODE: 
bne label

Use the below code,
CODE:
beq *+5
jmp label

equivalent for other branches, ie invert the condition and make the branch skip a jmp that will jump to the label.


BNE -> BEQ
Branch Z=0 -> Branch Z=1

BPL -> BMI
Branch N=0 -> Branch N=1

BEQ -> BNE
Branch Z=1 -> Branch Z=0
